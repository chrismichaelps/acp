# OpenAPI Contract Handoff

## Recovered Work

- Branch: `feat/openapi-export`; PR #332; issue #327.
- Docker ACP project: `acp-self-openapi`; workspace `workspace_mrlaz3fq1`;
  work `work_mrlaz41o2`.
- The branch already generated and served `openapi.json`, but four new source
  files lacked exact wiki mirrors and the generated contract advertised all
  protected operations as anonymous.
- Existing tests covered identity, representative paths, determinism, artifact
  drift, and a successful live GET only.

## Decisions

- [[ADR-0017-openapi-contract-artifact]] defines the generated artifact, public
  discovery endpoint, router-auth security repair, and same-version 0.x
  compatibility envelope.
- [[openapi-module]] uses upstream `OpenApi.OpenAPISpec`, declares `AcpSession`,
  and keeps only `session.initializeSession` public.
- [[openapi-route]] serves one in-memory projection and never reads the artifact.
- Native Effect RPC and generated language clients remain outside issue #327.

## Remaining

1. Commit the completed wiki/source-mirror contract.
2. Refactor the generator type and security projection; expand semantic and live
   route tests; regenerate `openapi.json`.
3. Run focused and complete repository gates plus Docker self-dogfood.
4. Attach PR evidence, open an ACP grill, obtain independent ACP review, resolve
   findings, merge PR #332, and close issue #327.

## Exact Next Action

Shadow role: lease the four implementation/artifact paths in workspace
`workspace_mrlaz3fq1`, then implement only the behavior already specified by
[[openapi-module]] and [[openapi-route]].
