Temporal ledger of logic deltas (one line each). Forensic Guardian appends.

  [[ADR-0001-architecture-foundation]]
- 2026-06-25 · storage slice · projected [[Storage]] seam to code: [[storage-index]],
  [[storage]] port, [[in-memory-store]] adapter, storage MOCs, and adapter tests for

  [[ADR-0001-architecture-foundation]]
- 2026-06-26 · http-transport slice · projected [[Transport]] HTTP contract to
  code: [[http-index]], [[acp-http-api]] Effect Platform API declaration,
  [[http-error-mapper]] JSON protocol error mapper, HTTP MOC, and tests for
  reflected v0.1 routes plus status/no-leak error responses · 34 tests green ·

  code: [[sse-index]], [[sse-event-stream]] frame/byte/response rendering,
  heartbeat comments from [[app-config]], SSE MOC, and tests for event frames,

  [[ADR-0001-architecture-foundation]]
- 2026-06-26 · worker-service slice · projected the [[Worker]] registry to code:
  [[worker-service-index]], [[worker-service]] service (register upsert, get, list,
  setStatus), workers MOC, and tests for register/read-back, upsert overwrite,
  missing-worker none, list, status update, and `NotFoundError` on missing.
  Grill-resolved: no per-workspace presence events this slice (Worker is
  host-scoped; deferred to a future host event stream) · 44 tests green · risk LOW ·
  [[ADR-0001-architecture-foundation]]
- 2026-06-26 · naming · renamed the HTTP API drift `HadoofHttpApi`/`hadoof-http-api`
  → `AcpHttpApi`/`acp-http-api` (`HttpApi.make('acp')`) per
  [[ADR-0001-architecture-foundation]] §Decision-1 (canonical name ACP); mirrored
  page [[acp-http-api]] + all wikilinks updated; historical "Hadoof" mentions kept
  only in the ADR/INDEX as rejected-name context · 44 tests green · risk LOW
- 2026-06-26 · workspace-service slice · projected the [[Workspace]] registry to
  code: [[workspace-service-index]], [[workspace-service]] service (create, get,
  list, update) emitting `workspace.created`/`workspace.updated` through
  [[EventStore]], workspaces MOC, and tests for create+event, list, update+event,
  missing-workspace none, and `NotFoundError` on update. Grill-resolved: Workspace
  emits its own events (it _is_ the per-workspace event scope); `workspace.archived`
  deferred (no lifecycle field in the wire schema) · 49 tests green · risk LOW ·
  [[ADR-0001-architecture-foundation]]
- 2026-06-26 · lease-service slice · projected the [[Lease]] lifecycle to code:
  [[lease-service-index]], [[lease-service]] service (request, get, list, renew,
  release, revoke, expireDue) with active-resource conflict detection, TTL from
  [[app-config]], `lease.*` events through [[EventStore]], leases MOC, and tests
  for grant+event, default TTL, conflict, renew, release/revoke, expiry sweep,
  missing lease, and expired renew rejection · 57 tests green · risk LOW ·
  [[ADR-0001-architecture-foundation]]
- 2026-06-26 · artifact-service slice · projected the [[Artifact]] registry to
  code: [[artifact-service-index]], [[artifact-service]] service (create, get,
  readContent, listForWork, listForWorkspace, remove) with host-stored
  `acp://artifacts/{id}` URIs, content-size validation from [[app-config]],
  `artifact.*` events through [[EventStore]], artifacts MOC, and tests for
  create+content+event, metadata-only artifacts, size rejection, list filters,
  removal+event, missing get, and missing remove · 64 tests green · risk LOW ·
  [[ADR-0001-architecture-foundation]]
- 2026-06-26 · checkpoint-service slice · projected the [[Checkpoint]] registry
  to code: [[checkpoint-service-index]], [[checkpoint-service]] service (create,
  get, listForWork, listForWorkspace, latestForWork) with append-only semantics,
  newest-first resume ordering, `checkpoint.created` events through
  [[EventStore]], checkpoints MOC, and tests for create+event, work/workspace
  filters, latest checkpoint, and missing checkpoint/latest none · 69 tests
  green · risk LOW · [[ADR-0001-architecture-foundation]]
- 2026-06-26 · review-service slice · projected the [[Review]] gate to code:
  [[review-service-index]], [[review-service]] service (request, get,
  listForWork, listForWorkspace, approve, reject, requestChanges) with
  WorkUnit-backed workspace resolution, requirement validation, `review.*`
  events through [[EventStore]], reviews MOC, and tests for request+event+work
  transition, approve requirements, unmet requirement rejection, changes
  requested transition, list filters, and missing review · 75 tests green · risk LOW ·
  [[ADR-0001-architecture-foundation]]
- 2026-06-26 · app-live slice · projected application Layer composition to code:
  [[app-live-index]], [[app-live]] in-memory dependency graph wiring
  [[app-config]], [[Storage]], [[EventStore]], WorkUnit, Worker, Workspace,
  Lease, Artifact, Checkpoint, and Review services for future server/CLI
  entrypoints · 76 tests green · risk LOW ·
  [[ADR-0001-architecture-foundation]]
- 2026-06-26 · http-server slice · projected the HTTP transport entrypoint to code:
  [[id-clock]] id/timestamp primitive, [[acp-router]] `HttpRouter` binding all 12
  spec §12 routes to the domain services (decode → mint id/now → delegate → encode →
  total error→status map via [[http-error-mapper]]) plus the SSE stream via
  [[sse-event-stream]], [[server-main]] Node `NodeHttpServer` entrypoint on
  `ACP_PORT`, server MOC, and web-handler tests for initialize, list, create/claim
  work, 404s, and lease request/release. Grill-resolved: manual router (not
  HttpApiBuilder) to reuse the existing correct-status error mapper without touching
  the merged [[acp-http-api]] contract; fixed `worker_system` actor until auth ·
  83 tests green · risk LOW · [[ADR-0001-architecture-foundation]]
