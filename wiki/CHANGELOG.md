# Changelog

Temporal ledger of logic deltas (one line each). Forensic Guardian appends.

- 2026-07-12 · final app/server test mirrors · distilled real socket boot,
  direct and derived tenant authorization, full native typed RPC parity,
  sweeper leadership, deterministic expiry/retention, and workspace-bound
  evidence creation; app/config test parity is complete and mirror debt is now
  47 domain/infrastructure/protocol tests with no production gaps or orphans ·
  validation: exact bidirectional path audit + repository-pinned Prettier · risk
  LOW · [[source-mirror-2026-07-10]]

- 2026-07-12 · resume/workspace server test mirrors · distilled full handoff
  composition, ETag/budget representations, pure salience and gate pinning,
  hosted session binding, and workspace-isolated work/evidence indexes;
  reconciled server/config MOCs and owning module backlinks; mirror debt is now
  53 missing tests with no production gaps or orphans · validation: exact
  bidirectional path audit + repository-pinned Prettier · risk LOW ·
  [[source-mirror-2026-07-10]]

- 2026-07-12 · focused server route test mirrors · distilled artifact evidence,
  event replay/filter/auth, full grill evaluation, lease lifecycle/scope,
  review-comment state, and host-scoped worker read contracts; reconciled server
  MOC and owning route/router backlinks; mirror debt is now 58 missing tests with
  no production gaps or orphans · validation: exact bidirectional path audit +
  Prettier · risk LOW · [[source-mirror-2026-07-10]]

- 2026-07-12 · server transport/auth test mirrors · distilled unauthenticated
  health probes, ordinary/secure identity minting, aggregate REST bootstrap and
  authorization, shared-store JSON-RPC HTTP framing, and real WebSocket
  auth/subscription behavior; reconciled server MOC and production backlinks;
  mirror debt is now 64 missing tests with no production gaps or orphans ·
  validation: exact bidirectional path audit + Prettier · risk LOW ·
  [[source-mirror-2026-07-10]]

- 2026-07-11 · server-side event type filter · live dogfood surfaced that
  `GET /v1/events` silently ignored a `type` filter (contract declared only
  `workspace_id`/`after_seq`/`limit`; the CLI filtered `--type` client-side, so
  non-CLI transports got the whole log). Added an optional lenient `type` query to
  [[acp-http-api-events|EventsReplayParams]], filtered the replay in
  [[event-routes]] within the read window, and migrated [[event-commands]] from a
  client filter to the server query; unknown types return an empty replay ·
  risk LOW · [[event-routes]]

- 2026-07-10 · agent permission documentation guard · corrected the root ACP
  skill's invalid `review:request` bootstrap scope to `review:create`; added a
  schema-derived checker for permission tokens in the skill, README, and
  canonical agent reference; Local Gates and aggregate Docker self-dogfood now
  reject vocabulary drift before build · risk LOW · refs #299

- 2026-07-10 · socket-proxy update-policy regression · stopped Dependabot from
  treating upstream Git-only socket-proxy releases as deployable Compose image
  upgrades while retaining monthly Traefik updates; the aggregate Docker
  self-dogfood now runs the exact-pin/automation guard before building, with
  focused success, ordering, and preflight-failure coverage · risk LOW · refs
  #297 · [[ADR-0008-deployment-storage-topology]]

- 2026-07-10 · bounded resume agent guidance · updated the public README, root
  agent skill, and its canonical integration reference with bounded resume
  commands, `elided` reference semantics, gate-critical review pinning, and the
  HTTP-only ETag revalidation boundary; command references now match the live CLI
  and Docker dogfood description · risk LOW ·
  [[ADR-0010-context-exchange-optimization]]

- 2026-07-10 · resume packet as a global workspace · gave
  `GET /v1/work/:id/resume` a stable `sha256` ETag with `If-None-Match` → `304`
  revalidation and an opt-in `?budget=N` salience-bounded view that elides
  lower-salience artifacts/reviews to `{count, ids}` refs; gate-critical reviews
  (approved + latest-grill) are pinned so a budgeted packet cannot flip the merge
  gate; pure [[resume-workspace]] module, additive `elided` field, backward
  compatible · risk LOW · [[ADR-0010-context-exchange-optimization]] · refs #580

- 2026-07-10 · focused CLI test mirrors · distilled the full four-agent CLI
  lifecycle, GitHub import/sync/merge orchestration, pure merge-gate reasoning,
  forced grill verdicts, memory requests, and diff-anchored review comments;
  reconciled CLI MOC and production backlinks, completing CLI test parity;
  mirror debt is now 69 missing tests with no production gaps or orphans after
  rebasing over the two new resume-workspace test sources ·
  validation: exact bidirectional path audit + Prettier · risk LOW ·
  [[source-mirror-2026-07-10]]

- 2026-07-10 · foundational CLI test mirrors · distilled the injected HTTP/auth
  and response-filter client contract, duplicate-safe longest-prefix command
  registry, aggregate argv projection, and focused event/lease/work parser
  behavior; reconciled CLI MOC and production backlinks; mirror debt is now 74
  missing tests with no production gaps or orphans · validation: exact
  bidirectional path audit + Prettier · risk LOW ·
  [[source-mirror-2026-07-10]]

- 2026-07-10 · app/config boundary test mirrors · distilled executable contracts
  for application-layer composition and SQLite persistence, log-level mapping,
  incremental UTF-8 stdio framing, and config defaults/profile precedence; added
  the missing config source MOC and reconciled module backlinks; mirror debt is
  now 80 missing tests with no production gaps or orphans · validation: exact
  bidirectional path audit + Prettier · risk LOW ·
  [[source-mirror-2026-07-10]]

- 2026-07-10 · RPC test mirror-name parity · renamed four existing RPC
  roundtrip pages from legacy `-test.md` names to their exact `.test.md` source
  mirrors, retained the old names as compatibility aliases, and reconciled MOC,
  source-page, audit, and historical backlinks; mirror debt is now 84 missing
  tests, 0 missing production/support, and 0 orphaned pages · validation: exact
  bidirectional path audit + Prettier · risk LOW ·
  [[source-mirror-2026-07-10]]

- 2026-07-10 · production source-mirror parity · distilled all 9 previously
  unregistered production/support modules, defined [[Host]], [[Grill]], and
  [[ReviewComment]], added missing domain/source MOCs, and reconciled outbound /
  inbound links; mirror debt is now 88 missing tests, 0 missing production, and 4
  known RPC naming orphans · validation: exact path audit + Prettier · risk LOW ·
  [[source-mirror-2026-07-10]]

- 2026-07-10 · source mirror audit · measured 250 TypeScript files against 157
  mirrored pages: 97 missing (9 production/support + 88 tests) and 4 orphaned RPC
  test pages; selected production parity → orphan rename → bounded test batches →
  enforcement, with implementation hard-locked until relevant pages exist · risk
  LOW · [[source-mirror-2026-07-10]]

- 2026-07-10 · GitHub-bridge sandbox dogfood lane · added the opt-in
  `dogfood:docker-gh-sandbox` lane (host bridge + Docker ACP host) and proved
  `acp gh` import, idempotent bidirectional sync, and denied-before-allowed merge
  against private `chrismichaelps/acp-gh-sandbox`; fail-closed topic/ref/path
  guards keep credentials in host `gh` and mutations out of contributor repos.
  Live run 1 exposed comment-before-grill ordering; [[github-review-thread]] now
  translates REST comment ids through paginated GraphQL thread lookup, and the
  lane resolves + re-syncs before evaluation. PR #3 records red/green gate
  comments, two resolved threads, sandbox-only merge, and guarded marker cleanup;
  the identical run id completed twice and restored README-only `main` with no
  residual branch/container/volume. The [[GitHub]] seam is FMCF
  `EXPLORATORY (2)`, its source folder is fully mirrored, and format, lint,
  typecheck, file-size, env, runtime-pin, build, focused/live gates, and full
  Vitest pass (484 passed, 13 skipped) · risk MEDIUM · [[gh-bridge]] · refs #268

- 2026-07-10 · ADR-0008 implementation reconciliation · replaced the stale
  direction-only deployment record with a source-backed implemented/partial/
  deferred ledger; aligned the canonical profile table with `AppConfig`, marked
  Postgres, pg-notify, workspace-bound auth, sweeper leadership, retention,
  Compose, and edge behavior as landed, and kept Redis, OIDC, managed hosting,
  production TLS, versioned migrations, and release publication explicitly
  unshipped · risk LOW · [[ADR-0008-deployment-storage-topology]]

- 2026-07-10 · Edge runtime update policy · retained exact multi-architecture
  pins for Traefik `v3.7.7` and the Docker socket proxy `v0.1.1`; added a
  monthly Compose-only Dependabot allowlist for those two images, a local/CI
  guard against floating tags, and a documented review boundary requiring the
  complete Docker self-dogfood gate for every runtime update · risk LOW ·
  [[ADR-0008-deployment-storage-topology]]

- 2026-07-10 · Traefik socket-proxy hardening · removed Traefik's direct Docker
  socket mount; added pinned Tecnativa proxy `v0.1.1` on an internal control
  network with read-only version/ping/event/container/network access; edge
  smoke now denies mutations and unrelated image, volume, and system APIs while
  retaining SQLite and two-replica HA discovery · risk MEDIUM ·
  [[ADR-0008-deployment-storage-topology]]

- 2026-07-09 · Docker runtime and HA self-dogfood hardening · pinned Traefik
  `v3.7.7` for Docker Engine 29 provider compatibility and made edge failures
  surface immediately; pruned production dependencies in the build stage so
  the runtime image no longer ships pnpm and fell from 594 MB to 445 MB; reused
  prebuilt images across composed gates; strengthened HA dogfood to require two
  healthy replicas, cross-replica Postgres notification delivery, and exactly
  one sweeper-driven `lease.expired` event · validation: production image boot,
  SQLite/HA edge smoke, and two-replica HA lifecycle passed locally · risk
  MEDIUM · [[ADR-0008-deployment-storage-topology]]

- 2026-07-09 · Traefik HA edge regression gate · removed the fixed `acp-ha`
  container name and replaced its fixed host binding with the bounded
  `4317`–`4326` range, so Compose can create multiple HA replicas while keeping
  the first direct endpoint on `4317`; restricted the insecure dashboard to
  loopback and expanded Docker CI to require routing, TLS security headers,
  host-rule rejection, dashboard service health, and two discovered HA
  backends · risk MEDIUM · [[ADR-0008-deployment-storage-topology]]

- 2026-07-09 · Traefik edge proxy · added an opt-in `edge` Compose profile
  fronting the ACP host with TLS termination, rate-limiting, compression,
  security headers, HA load-balancing, and a live dashboard — free OSS,
  clone-and-go (`npm run acp:edge:up`). Traefik owns `:80`/`:443`/`:8080`;
  `4317` stays published so `./bin/acp` is unaffected; self-signed TLS by
  default (no ACME); load-balances across `acp-ha` replicas via `--scale`; an
  opt-in basic-auth toggle (`htpasswd -nbB acp acp`) is documented but not
  shipped live · risk LOW · [[ADR-0008-deployment-storage-topology]]

- 2026-07-09 · Feature 580 scale tier (domain queryBy migration) · closed the
  O(N)→O(log N) loop on scoped domain reads: work-units, artifacts, checkpoints,
  leases, and reviews `listForWork` now use indexed [[storage]] `queryBy` instead
  of `list`+filter. Adapter conformance suite asserts `queryBy` + version-CAS
  parity across InMemory/SQLite. Host-scoped registries (workspaces, workers,
  sessions) and review `listForWorkspace` (work join; no workspace index) keep
  full-collection reads by design. Seam [[Storage]] + domain service algorithms
  updated · risk LOW · [[ADR-0010-context-exchange-optimization]]

- 2026-07-08 · gh-driven-workflow feature (Sub-project B) · bound ACP's native
  review gate to real GitHub PRs behind a new edge seam. Added the [[GitHub]]
  `Context.Tag` ([[github-gateway]]) with a `gh`-CLI adapter ([[github-gateway-gh]])
  and a scripted fake ([[github-gateway-fake]]), fed by a confined
  [[node-process-io|runProcess]] execFile primitive (argv array, `shell: false`;
  ACP never handles a GitHub token). Added the `acp gh import|sync|merge` bridge
  ([[gh-bridge]] + `gh-reconcile`): import pulls a PR diff into `diff`/`pull_request`
  artifacts; sync is an idempotent bidirectional review-comment reconcile keyed on
  provenance + `external_id` (new additive `origin`/`external_id` on
  [[review-comment-service|ReviewComment]] + a `setExternalId` service method and
  `POST /v1/review-comments/:id/external-id` route); merge posts a decision issue
  comment and gate-checks the [[resume-schema|resume packet]] (review approved +
  grill passed + no open comments) read-only before `gh pr merge`. A pure-core
  invariant test forbids the github infra / `child_process` / `gh` in the domain
  core and main server layer · validation: typecheck, lint, prettier, file-size,
  and full Vitest passed locally · risk MEDIUM

- 2026-07-07 · pr-review-grill-gate feature · added an ACP-native senior review
  gate: diff-anchored [[review-comment-service|review comments]] and a forced
  senior-question [[grill-service|grill]] (open → ask → answer → verdict →
  evaluate) whose gate rule passes only when every blocker question is accepted
  and every review comment is resolved. Exposed the full surface over HTTP/RPC
  ([[review-comment-routes]], [[grill-routes]]; review lifecycle handlers split
  into [[review-routes]] to hold [[acp-router]] under the file-size gate) and the
  CLI (`acp review comment …`, `acp grill …` via [[cli-review-comment-commands]]
  and [[cli-grill-commands]]). Enriched the [[resume-schema|resume packet]] with
  `open_comments` and `latest_grill` so a resuming reviewer sees open gate
  obligations in one read, and drove the whole loop end-to-end (pass + fail
  rounds) through the multi-agent CLI dogfood · validation: typecheck, lint,
  prettier, file-size, and full Vitest (418 passed, 13 skipped) passed locally at
  each task commit · risk MEDIUM

- 2026-07-05 · cli-command-prefix-dispatch slice · refactored
  [[cli-commands]] so `parseArgs` is generated by `buildCommandParser`, which
  tokenizes registered command keys and resolves the longest matching prefix
  instead of assuming a fixed two-token command shape. Existing command modules
  still own their handlers, duplicate keys still fail fast, and the regression
  suite now proves one-, two-, and three-token command routing for future CLI
  growth · validation: typecheck, lint, prettier, file-size, env, and Docker CLI
  dogfood passed locally; full Vitest is deferred to CI because local
  `node_modules` is missing the Rolldown optional native binding · risk LOW

- 2026-07-05 · events-replay-limit slice · added bounded event replay across
  [[storage]], [[event-store]], HTTP, JSON-RPC, native RPC, and
  [[cli-event-commands]]. `GET /v1/events` now accepts an optional positive
  `limit`, `acp events list --limit <n>` forwards it, and SQLite/Postgres apply
  the cap in the `(workspace_id, seq)` query instead of trimming after decode.
  This gives agents a token- and IO-efficient way to fetch a short replay tail
  while keeping `--type` as a client-side open-payload filter · validation:
  typecheck passed locally; focused Vitest is blocked locally by the missing
  Rolldown optional native binding and will be covered by CI/Docker dogfood ·
  risk MEDIUM

- 2026-07-05 · cli-events-list-type-filter slice · added
  `acp events list --type <event_type>` as a client-side event replay filter.
  The command keeps the existing `GET /v1/events?workspace_id=&after_seq=`
  route and narrows the returned array by `type` before printing, so agents can
  ask for one event class without dumping the full replay tail into context.
  Docker dogfood asserts the filter against a real `work.completed` event ·
  validation: focused event/client tests, typecheck, lint, prettier, file-size,
  env, full suite (371 passed, 8 skipped), and Docker CLI dogfood passed · risk
  LOW

- 2026-07-05 · resume-work-packet slice · added `GET /v1/work/<id>/resume` and
  `acp work resume <id>` as the compact handoff read for token-efficient agent
  recovery. The response contains the work record, optional latest checkpoint,
  artifact metadata, and reviews without embedding artifact content or replaying
  the event log. The HTTP contract lives in a new resume API group to keep
  [[acp-http-api]] under the file-size gate · validation: focused resume/CLI/API
  tests, typecheck, lint, prettier, file-size, env, full suite (370 passed, 8
  skipped), and Docker CLI dogfood passed · risk MEDIUM

- 2026-07-05 · cli-artifact-list-kind-filter slice · added
  `acp artifact list --kind <kind>` as a client-side artifact kind filter over
  work-scoped or workspace-scoped artifact lists. The command still uses the
  existing artifact collection routes; [[cli-client]] narrows the returned array
  by `kind`, giving agents a direct way to recover patch, markdown, log, or pull
  request artifacts without changing artifact routes, schema, or storage. Docker
  dogfood creates two artifact kinds and filters back only the markdown report ·
  validation: focused CLI tests, typecheck, lint, prettier, file-size, env, full
  suite (369 passed, 8 skipped), and Docker CLI dogfood passed · risk LOW

- 2026-07-05 · cli-lease-list-holder-filter slice · added
  `acp lease list --holder <holder>` as a client-side holder filter over the
  workspace lease list. The command still hits `GET /v1/leases?workspace_id=`;
  [[cli-client]] narrows the returned array by `holder`, giving agents a direct
  recovery query for their own lease claims without changing lease routes,
  schema, or storage. Docker dogfood now requests, filters, and releases a real
  lease in the production image · validation: focused CLI tests, typecheck,
  lint, prettier, file-size, env, full suite (368 passed, 8 skipped), and Docker
  CLI dogfood passed · risk LOW

- 2026-07-05 · cli-work-list-assignee-filter slice · added
  `acp work list --assigned-to <worker_id>` as another client-side list filter
  on the generic `clientFilters` path. The flag maps to the wire `assigned_to`
  field, giving agents a direct "show my assigned work" query while keeping the
  host route, schema, and storage contracts unchanged. Docker dogfood proves the
  filter against a claimed work item in the production image · validation:
  focused CLI tests, typecheck, lint, prettier, file-size, env, full suite (367
  passed, 8 skipped), and Docker CLI dogfood passed · risk LOW

- 2026-07-05 · cli-work-list-priority-filter slice · extended the client-side
  work-list narrowing path from a single `filterState` field to generic
  `clientFilters`, then added `acp work list --priority <p>` alongside
  `--state`. The route remains `GET /v1/workspaces/<id>/work`; filtering happens
  after fetch in [[cli-client]] so the typed host API and storage contracts stay
  unchanged. The Docker-hosted CLI dogfood lane now creates high and normal work
  items and asserts both priority-only and combined priority/state filtering in
  the production image · validation: focused CLI tests, typecheck, lint,
  prettier, file-size, env, full suite (365 passed, 8 skipped), and Docker CLI
  dogfood passed · risk LOW

- 2026-07-05 · cli-work-list-state-filter slice · added a client-side `--state`
  filter to `acp work list` so an agent can surface claimable (`open`) work with
  one flag: [[cli-work-commands]] records `filterState` on the `CliRequest`,
  [[cli-command-support]]'s contract carries it, and [[cli-client]]'s new pure
  `applyClientFilter` narrows the JSON-array response after fetch (passthrough on
  non-array/unparseable bodies), applied by [[cli-main]] before printing.
  Client-side by design (grillme) — the work-list route is a typed HttpApi
  endpoint and [[acp-http-api]] sits at the file-size gate, so no host/schema/
  storage change. Dogfooded through the ACP container (workspace acp-self,
  planner/worker/reviewer): validated live after image rebuild — `--state open`
  and `--state running` correctly partition a 3-item workspace · validation:
  tsc, eslint, prettier, file-size, env, and full suite (361 tests) passed · risk
  LOW

- 2026-07-05 · acp-agent-skill slice · authored the canonical
  [[agent-integration]] wiki reference (how an autonomous worker connects,
  claims, leases, checkpoints, hands off via memory, requests/handles review,
  completes, and recovers by replaying events) and projected it to the root
  `ACP-SKILL.md` skill file with `name: acp` frontmatter so any agent harness can
  load it as the ACP interaction reference. Docs only — no source logic. Every
  documented command was validated live against the Dockerized `sqlite` host via
  `bin/acp`: the full lifecycle replayed (workspace→…→completed, including a real
  lease_conflict) and the verbatim operating loop drove work to `completed` ·
  validation: prettier format:check on both new markdown files passed · risk LOW

- 2026-07-05 · readme-onboarding-refresh slice · rewrote README as a
  developer-onboarding guide: foregrounded the Dockerized host + `bin/acp`
  wrapper as the 60-second daily-driver path, added a tutorial-style first
  coordinated task, trimmed reference prose, and removed the Repository-layout
  and Design-record sections; refreshed the GitHub About description and topics.
  Docs/metadata only — no logic change; Docker CLI dogfood re-run green (11-event
  lifecycle) to back the daily-driver framing · validation: prettier
  format:check on README passed · risk LOW

- 2026-07-05 · signed-approval-host-capability slice · added
  `supports_signed_review_approvals` to the session host capability descriptor
  across the HTTP schema, REST host response, native RPC session response, specs,
  and [[acp-http-api]] wiki page so clients can discover that signed review
  approval evidence is accepted and persisted without implying cryptographic
  verification · validation: focused session/router/http/RPC tests, format,
  lint, typecheck, file-size, env, and full test suite passed · risk LOW

- 2026-07-05 · signed-review-approval-evidence slice · added optional
  signed-approval evidence to [[review.schema]], HTTP approval payloads,
  [[review-service]], CLI review approval flags, JSON-RPC and native RPC review
  approval paths, and the Docker HA dogfood lane. Unsigned approvals remain
  compatible; signed approvals persist the reviewer-supplied algorithm, key id,
  signature value, and optional signed timestamp on the Review and
  `review.approved` event without claiming cryptographic verification ·
  validation: focused schema/review/CLI/JSON-RPC/RPC/router tests, typecheck,
  and file-size passed · risk MEDIUM

- 2026-07-05 · fmcf-lease-lock-cli-dispatch-sync slice · reconciled the FMCF
  vault after the HA arbitration and CLI parser slices: added the
  [[lease-resource-lock]] mirror page, linked it from the leases MOC and
  [[lease-service]], and updated [[cli-commands]] to describe the explicit
  command invocation plus ordered dispatch-rule parser model · validation:
  Markdown formatting and repository format check passed · risk LOW

- 2026-07-05 · cli-parse-dispatch-pattern slice · refactored `parseArgs` around
  an explicit command invocation and ordered dispatch-rule pattern so command
  lookup, fallback handling, and handler invocation scale through the registry
  instead of central parser branching; preserved the public `CliRequest` surface
  and added regressions for unknown commands and missing subcommands ·
  validation: focused CLI parser/auth tests, typecheck, and file-size passed ·
  risk LOW

- 2026-07-05 · docker-ha-multi-agent-dogfood slice · expanded the reusable
  Postgres/HA Docker proof from restart durability into a real multi-agent
  lifecycle: planner, two workers, and reviewer sessions now contend for a work
  claim and a resource lease, persist checkpoint/memory/artifact handoff state,
  run request-changes then approval, restart the host mid-review and after
  completion, and replay the Postgres event log for monotonic sequence and
  required lifecycle events. The run exposed two production races, so storage now
  exposes atomic `putIfAbsent` and `replaceIf` operations across memory, SQLite,
  and Postgres; work claims use conditional replacement, lease resources use a
  deterministic Postgres-safe lock row, and `pg-notify` publishing uses
  `SELECT pg_notify(...)` to avoid parameterized `NOTIFY` syntax failures ·
  validation: focused work-unit/lease/storage/event tests and Docker HA dogfood
  passed locally with 23 replayed events · risk MEDIUM

- 2026-07-04 · docker-ha-dogfood-runner slice · added
  `scripts/acp-docker-ha-dogfood.mjs` and the `dogfood:docker-ha` package script
  so the Postgres/HA Compose profile can be validated outside GitHub Actions with
  the same production-oriented flow: start `--profile ha`, drive `./bin/acp`
  against `acp-ha`, write workspace/work/checkpoint/memory state, restart the
  host, read work and events back from Postgres, and tear the stack down ·
  documented and drift-checked the Docker dogfood environment controls in
  `.env.example`, then wired the Docker workflow's HA job to call the reusable
  Node script instead of inlining shell.

- 2026-07-04 · docker-ha-profile-and-ci slice · added a Compose `ha` profile (the
  ADR-0008 self-host-ha stack: `postgres:16-alpine` + `pg-notify` fan-out,
  auto-migrating on boot) alongside the default `sqlite` profile in one
  `docker-compose.yml`, taught `bin/acp` to auto-detect the running host service
  (`acp` or `acp-ha`), added `acp:ha:up`/`down`/`logs` npm scripts, and added a
  `.github/workflows/docker.yml` CI guard with two jobs — the Docker-hosted CLI
  dogfood and a Postgres/HA durability check that creates work, restarts the host,
  and reads it back. No untrusted GitHub event input reaches any `run:` step ·
  validation: both Compose profiles pass `docker compose config`; local
  lint/format/typecheck/file-size/env/tests green; Docker/HA runtime proven on CI
  (local Docker store was disk-full) · risk LOW

- 2026-07-04 · docker-daily-driver slice · packaged the full ACP host as a
  persistent Docker service for terminal-first feature work: `docker-compose.yml`
  runs the production image with durable SQLite on a named volume (`local`
  profile, auth off → mutations as `worker_system`), a `bin/acp` wrapper drives
  the compiled CLI inside the container (symlink-safe for PATH installs, forwards
  `ACP_RPC_TOKEN`, refuses with a hint when the host is down), a Dockerfile
  `/data` mount point owned by the `node` user makes the volume writable
  non-root, and `acp:up`/`acp:down`/`acp:logs` npm scripts plus a README section
  document it · validation: `docker compose up -d --build` → host healthy, drove
  `acp workspace/work create + list` via the wrapper, and confirmed state
  survives `docker compose restart` (work read back by id after restart) ·
  risk LOW

- 2026-07-04 · docker-dogfood-event-sequence slice · tightened
  `npm run dogfood:docker-cli` from set-style required event checks to an exact
  event sequence assertion, so duplicate review lifecycle emissions and
  out-of-order replay drift fail the production-image dogfood lane immediately ·
  validation: script syntax check, format, lint, typecheck, file-size, and build
  passed; Docker execution blocked locally by usage-limit guard · risk LOW

- 2026-07-04 · review-event-deduplication slice · fixed duplicate
  `review.approved` / `review.rejected` / `review.changes_requested` emissions
  by letting `ReviewService` own the review event while moving the coupled work
  state through a silent internal transition. Approval and request-changes tests
  now pin the exact event history, matching the duplicate caught by the
  Docker-hosted CLI dogfood runner · validation: targeted review/work-unit tests
  passed (15 tests), plus check:env, format, lint, typecheck, file-size, and
  build; Docker rerun blocked by usage-limit guard · risk MEDIUM

- 2026-07-04 · docker-cli-dogfood-runner slice · added
  `scripts/acp-docker-cli-dogfood.mjs` and `npm run dogfood:docker-cli` so ACP
  can repeatedly build its production Docker image, run the host container, drive
  the compiled CLI inside that container, verify the workspace/work/review event
  lifecycle, and tear the container down automatically · validation:
  `npm run dogfood:docker-cli` passed with `workspace_mr6rwfvt1` /
  `work_mr6rwgr82` and 12 replayed events · risk LOW

- 2026-07-04 · spec-cli-parity slice · refreshed `specs.md` §22 from the old

  (create, get, total `resolveActor`), sessions MOC; [[acp-router]] now mints a
  session at `initialize` (returning `session_id` + host capabilities, replacing the
  worker-echo response) and resolves the `Authorization: Bearer` actor for each

  `resolveActor`→`authorize(scope?)` now resolves the bearer session and gates each
  mutation — no token → `worker_system`, invalid token or missing scope →
  `401 unauthorized` (reusing [[protocol-error]] `UnauthorizedError`). Grill-resolved:
  scopes are a separate authorization set (not derived from §9 capabilities), and

  composition; [[server-main]] now launches it, [[server-index]] re-exports it.
  Added an end-to-end live-boot test that binds a real `NodeHttpServer` on an
  ephemeral port (`port: 0`) and round-trips `initialize` → scoped `createWork`
  over HTTP, proving the socket boot, bearer-token actor resolution, and spec §8
  scope enforcement all compose. Grill-resolved: a real ephemeral socket over the

  ([[sweeper]]): `sweepOnce` reads `now` from [[id-clock]], evicts sessions older
  than `config.sessionTtl` via new [[session-service]] `list`/`evictExpired`, and
  lapses every due active lease via new [[lease-service]] `expireAllDue` (scans all
  workspaces, emits `lease.expired`). `SweeperLive` `forkScoped`s the loop on
  `config.sweepInterval`, merged into [[http-app]] over the shared `AppLive` so the
  router and sweeper evict from one store. Added `ACP_SESSION_TTL` (1h) and
  `ACP_SWEEP_INTERVAL` (60s) to [[app-config]]. Grill-resolved: poll loop over
  per-entity timers; forked in the host scope (not a second `AppLive` in main, which
  would split-brain the store); lease lapse reuses the existing `lease.expired`
  event, session eviction emits none (host-local auth state). · 107 tests green ·
  risk LOW · [[ADR-0001-architecture-foundation]]
- 2026-06-27 · mandatory-auth slice · added `ACP_REQUIRE_AUTH` to [[app-config]]

  unauthenticated mutations to `worker_system`, while hardened mode rejects missing
  bearer sessions with `401 unauthorized`; `session/initialize` remains the open
  bootstrap route that mints the bearer token. Added config and router regression
  tests plus mirrored config/router notes for the runtime switch · 109 tests green · risk LOW ·

  keyed/event tables, prepared statements per Layer, WAL + `busy_timeout`, atomic
  `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` event appends, primary-key query-plan assertions for hot reads,

  `ACP_STORAGE_ADAPTER`/`ACP_SQLITE_PATH` so [[app-live]] can choose memory or
  [[sqlite-store]] without changing domain services. [[http-app]] now exposes
  `StorageError` as a startup error, and an app-level regression proves
  [[worker-service]] state persists across two SQLite-backed `AppLive` instances.
  Memory remains the default to avoid creating local database files unless
  configured · 119 tests green · risk LOW · [[ADR-0001-architecture-foundation]]
- 2026-06-27 · json-rpc-runtime slice · added [[json-rpc-runtime]] (`executeJsonRpc`):
  executes the [[json-rpc]] canonical commands against the host via an injected,
  transport-agnostic `JsonRpcDispatch`, folding outcomes into JSON-RPC 2.0
  responses — request/notification correlation (notifications get no reply even on
  failure), batch handling (sendable-only, `-32600` for an empty batch), stream
  rejection (`events.subscribe` → `-32603`, use the SSE route), and HTTP-status →
  reserved-code mapping (`400`→`-32602`, other non-2xx→`-32603`, ACP error kept in
  `data`). Fixed a latent [[json-rpc]] bug: full-payload methods now forward the
  validated **wire** body (`validatedBody`) instead of the decoded Option-wrapped
  form, which is not serializable onto the HTTP API. Tested with a fake dispatch
  (folding rules) and the real [[acp-router]] web handler (`session.initialize` →
  scoped `work.create` round-trip; scope-denied → `-32603`). Grill-resolved: reuse
  the router via dispatch (no duplicate routing/auth); ship the execution core
  transport-agnostic before any stdio/WS/`POST /rpc` framing. · 138 tests green ·
  risk LOW · [[ADR-0001-architecture-foundation]]
- 2026-06-27 · json-rpc-http slice · added the `POST /rpc` framing ([[rpc-endpoint]]),
  the first concrete transport over [[json-rpc-runtime]]: reads a JSON-RPC 2.0 payload
  (single/batch), supplies a `JsonRpcDispatch` that replays each command against the
  in-process [[acp-router]] (`HttpServerRequest.fromWeb` → run `v1Router` →
  `HttpServerResponse.toWeb`) in the shared service context, and returns the response
  JSON (`204` when all notifications, `-32700` for a non-JSON body). Split the router
  into `v1Router` (the `/v1` REST routes) and `acpRouter = v1Router + POST /rpc` so
  dispatch never recurses into `/rpc`; made [[json-rpc-runtime]] `executeJsonRpc`/
  `JsonRpcDispatch` generic over requirements `R` so a dispatch can run in a service
  context. Tested over the `acpRouter` web handler: round-trip, a `/rpc`-minted session
  authorizing a direct `/v1` call (proving one shared store), notification `204`, batch
  folding, unknown-method `-32601`, non-JSON `-32700`. Grill-resolved: replay the shared
  router (no second `AppLive` split-brain); dispatch into `v1Router` not `acpRouter`
  (acyclic). · 144 tests green · risk LOW · [[ADR-0001-architecture-foundation]]
