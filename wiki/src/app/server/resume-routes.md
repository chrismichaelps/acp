# Resume Routes

## Purpose

Expose work-scoped read endpoints for handoff and recovery. These handlers turn
the existing domain read capabilities into transport responses so a worker can
reconstruct a [[WorkUnit]]'s current resume packet without replaying the entire
[[Event]] stream client-side. The same module also exposes host-stored artifact
content by artifact id, because artifact metadata uses `acp://artifacts/{id}` as
the public handle for private content stored by [[artifact-service]].

## Interface

```typescript
export const getWork: HttpRouter handler
export const listWorkCheckpoints: HttpRouter handler
export const latestWorkCheckpoint: HttpRouter handler
export const listWorkArtifacts: HttpRouter handler
export const listWorkReviews: HttpRouter handler
export const getArtifactContent: HttpRouter handler
```

### Routes

- `GET /v1/work/{work_id}` → [[WorkUnit]]
- `GET /v1/work/{work_id}/checkpoints` → newest-first [[Checkpoint]][]
- `GET /v1/work/{work_id}/checkpoints/latest` → latest [[Checkpoint]]
- `GET /v1/work/{work_id}/artifacts` → [[Artifact]][]
- `GET /v1/work/{work_id}/reviews` → [[Review]][]
- `GET /v1/artifacts/{artifact_id}/content` → `{ content: string }`

## Algorithm

Each handler reads `work_id`, authorizes `workspace:read`, verifies the
[[WorkUnit]] exists through [[work-unit-service]], then delegates to the matching
domain read method and schema-encodes the response. List endpoints return empty
arrays for existing work with no checkpoints, artifacts, or reviews. The
latest-checkpoint endpoint returns `404 not_found` when the work exists but no
checkpoint has been published.

`getArtifactContent` reads `artifact_id`, authorizes `workspace:read`, verifies
the [[Artifact]] metadata exists, then returns host-stored content when present.
External artifact references and deleted/missing artifacts return `404
not_found`; callers should follow the artifact metadata URI for external
systems.

Each handler passes its stable route template to [[route-support]] `respond` so
read-path telemetry records route/status/duration without logging work or
artifact identifiers.

## Negative Logic (Prohibited Paths)

- ❌ Do NOT duplicate checkpoint or artifact filtering in the router.
- ❌ Do NOT expose workspace-wide lists in this first slice; keep the resume packet
  work-scoped.
- ❌ Do NOT expose artifact content through event payloads or artifact metadata
  lists.
- ❌ Do NOT bypass [[route-support]] authorization or error folding.

## Depth

DEEP (0.7). A narrow handler module hides work-existence checks, read
authorization, and response encoding for the resume surface while keeping
[[acp-router]] under the file-size gate.
