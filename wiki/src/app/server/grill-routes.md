# Grill Routes

## Purpose

The HTTP handlers for the forced senior-question review gate
([[grill-service]]): open a grill, ask/answer/decide questions, evaluate the
gate, and read grill state. Split out of the near-limit [[router]] central file,
each handler is the canonical decode → [[grill-service]] → encode transport
boundary behind the `workspace:write` / `workspace:read` scopes.

## Interface

```typescript
export const openGrill // POST /v1/reviews/:review_id/grill
export const addGrillQuestion // POST /v1/grills/:grill_id/questions
export const answerGrillQuestion // POST /v1/grill-questions/:question_id/answer
export const setGrillVerdict // POST /v1/grill-questions/:question_id/verdict
export const evaluateGrill // POST /v1/grills/:grill_id/evaluate
export const getGrill // GET  /v1/grills/:grill_id
export const listReviewGrills // GET  /v1/reviews/:review_id/grills
```

## Algorithm

`openGrill` decodes `OpenGrillPayload`, mints a `grill` id + `now`, authorizes
`workspace:write` on the body `workspace_id` (returned worker is `opened_by`),
and encodes the new [[Grill]] at `201`. `addGrillQuestion` resolves the grill's
workspace via [[resource-workspace-auth]] `grill`, mints a `grillquestion` id,
and encodes the [[GrillQuestion]] at `201`. `answerGrillQuestion` /
`setGrillVerdict` resolve workspace via `resource-workspace-auth` `grillQuestion`
(question → parent grill → `workspace_id`), decode `AnswerGrillQuestionPayload` /
`SetGrillVerdictPayload`, and encode the mutated question at `200`.
`evaluateGrill` authorizes `workspace:write` on the grill and returns the
`GrillEvaluation` gate verdict at `200`. `getGrill` authorizes `workspace:read`
and encodes the `{ grill, questions }` [[GrillDetail]] composite at `200`;
`listReviewGrills` authorizes via `review` and encodes the `Grill[]` at `200`.

## Negative Logic (Prohibited Paths)

- ❌ Do NOT embed the gate rule (blockers accepted + comments resolved) here —
  it lives in [[grill-service]] `evaluate`.
- ❌ Do NOT authorize question mutations against a body `workspace_id` — a
  [[GrillQuestion]] carries none; walk question → grill → workspace.
- ❌ Do NOT return the bare `Grill` from `getGrill` — the composite `GrillDetail`
  (grill + its questions) is the read contract.
- ❌ Do NOT mint ids or read the clock outside [[id-clock]].

## Depth

MEDIUM (0.64). Thin transport handlers carrying scope gates plus the
question→grill→workspace authorization walk for id-keyed question mutations.

## Grill Log

- **Q:** Why do the `answer`/`verdict` routes resolve workspace through
  `grillQuestion` (question → grill → workspace) instead of reading it off the
  question?
  **A:** A [[GrillQuestion]] deliberately stores only `grill_id`, not a
  duplicated `workspace_id`; the parent [[Grill]] is the single owner of tenant
  scope. The helper walks one hop up so the question record stays minimal and the
  authorization decision has one source. _Rejected:_ denormalizing
  `workspace_id` onto every question.

- **Q:** Why does `getGrill` return `GrillDetail` rather than the bare `Grill`?
  **A:** A resuming reviewer needs the grill and its questions together to see
  outstanding obligations; splitting them into two reads would re-introduce the
  N+1 the resume packet exists to avoid.
